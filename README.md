# Car Buddy

Welcome to the future of car maintenance.

# Problem:
Everyone (regular people) has a smart phone, but half the time you have a car issue you end up stuck. Whether thats with on the side of the road, in the comfort of your home or at work/school it's a burden we all face as commuters.

# Solution:
Is to provide a platform that connects responsible car owners and hardworking mechanics on a application. Making people’s lives easier. Bringing business to not only small startups but also to the world’s biggest brands.

# Process:
Like most applications that provide a service, you will need to sign up with some personal information. The current beta version requires simple user data such as Name (First, Last), Vehicle (Year, Make, Model, Type) and login information (Email, Password).

As a customer you will be able to request services for you vehicle. (Oil Change, Towing, Car Wash, Jump-Start ETC.)

Or the alternative is to register as a Company account that requires Name (Company/Independent Contactor) and Services Provided (Qualifications).

Logging into a company account allows you to accept incoming jobs and mark as complete when ready to receive payment.
